High level idea: 

Use Mongodb for the database, using Node as both an API server on top of that database, and as a web server to host all of our assets, and use React on the front end to consume our API data and build a user interface suitable for the features of our application.

1. Getting started

   - Modern Javascript

     - Let: use the let to define the variable, which means it only work for the block when its initial.    

     - Const: canot be change after its initialization (immutable)

     - one line function

       ``` 
       const square = a => a * a
       
       [1, 2, 3].map(a => a*a); // [1, 4, 9]
       ```

     - define function with regular scope and arrow scope
